# TASK 4: Branching -- DONE

1. On your local machine, create a new branch called "adding-function" and check out this branch.
2. In index.js, add a function that adds two numbers, and after the "Hello World", print out the sum of 5+10 by calling this function.
3. Push the changes to the branch with the commit message "added adding function"

```js
const addFunc = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(addFunc(5, 10));
```

# TASK 5 – Merge Conflicts

- Find a partner and have him/her clone your repository and check out the master branch.
- Your partner should change the "Hello World" to "I caused a merge conflict."
- Afterwards your partner should check their changes back into the master branch with the commit message "partner changes".

If there is no partner available for you, you may 
- get back the github website, 
- change the file index.js in the master branch, and commit the change in the github website. 
- Now attempt to merge the local branch "adding function" into the master branch at GitHub. This will involve several steps. 
- You need to pull the latest version from the github website, which will create a merge conflict that need to be resolved.
